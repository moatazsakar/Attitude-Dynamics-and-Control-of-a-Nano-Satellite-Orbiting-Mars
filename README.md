# Attitude-Dynamics-and-Control-of-a-Nano-Satellite-Orbiting-Mars
This project is a simulation of Nano-Satellite attitude dynamics and control system orbiting Mars. The project is to design a thruster based attitude control to acheieve three pointing modes.
Science mode: The satellite camera must point to mars.
Communication mode: The satellite must point to the large satellite to transfer data.
Power mode: The satellite must point the solar panels to the sun to recharge.

The project is still under develoment [Not completed]
